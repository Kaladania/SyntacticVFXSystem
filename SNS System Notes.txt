SNS System Notes:


- Instead of passing in a visual effect asset via components, just pass the enum (think of it like a JSON file)
- Then, when generating the particle system, the enums can be used to load the correct VFX assests


Element Component (e.g. Water Component)
- Type: Element (enum)
- Role: Base/Extra (enum)
- Scale: int
- Speed: int
- Colour: colour
- …


- Side note - When loading elements, have the impact of the element decrease by 20% each level (e.g. element 2 is 100%, element 3 is 80%, …)
- Scale is automatically updated (e.g. if element place is 4th, scale = 0.6)
	- Add them all together during the generation stage (e.g if water element is 2nd (100%) and 4th (60%) total scale of water element contributions will be x1.6




Instead of trying to access the component type to know what data to load, just spawn all the VFX assets by assuming each component hold the correct data

Demo game envirmonent:

- Shoot the colours
	- Colour Rectangle enemies spawn and try to approach you
		- Enemies just move in a straight line
		- You're restricted and can only rotate to launch a projectile
	- A specific colour can only be killed by a specific element
	- The purpose of combining elements is that the projectile doesn't despawn till offscreen
		- multiple elements means it can kill multiple colours


IF wanting to be more complex
	- More powerful enemies are bigger
		- Increase in scale numerically: x1, x1.25, x1.5
		- When an enemy is hit, it shrinks
			- x1 is their last life. The next hit kills the enemy
	- Have the elements change how the spell works
		- Fire is direct single impact (more fire, more impact: e.g. 3 element = 3 impact)
		- Earth is AOE (more earth, wider range: e.g. 3 element = 3x the area of impact)
		- Electric is speed (more electric, faster projectile: e.g. 3 element = 3x the speed)
		- Water is number of projectiles (more water, more projectiles spawned simultaneously: e.g. 3 element = 3x the projectiles).
